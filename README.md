# Determining the speed of an object from images

### Limitations/Growth Potential
Because I did this as an assignment for a computer vision class in college, I had limited time and needed to be satisfied with only completing what was required. With that being said, the code could be improved in the following ways:
- Improved accuracy by taking more frames into account
  - Taking a video from input and extracting more frames would allow more data and a resonable change to the calculation of speed would result in more accuracy
- More universal detection of object with a change of criteria
  - If I instead looked for circles via a Hough Transform I could look for any color car (could have issues if many cars are in frame)
  - Could be adapted to find the speed of various other objects with a change to the object detection.
